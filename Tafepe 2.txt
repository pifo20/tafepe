Tafepe/𐝁𐀏꘠ (the simplest language)
TAFEPE DOCUMENTATION VERSION 2

I've been working on a larger language, Sujaliro, for a while now, and while I'm definitely not done making it yet, I recently came up with an interesting idea for a conlang.

What might happen if you make a language where the grammar rules are simply to convey meaning in a way that makes sense, and then just have a list of words that stand for concepts? If you teach it to a group of people, would they eventually form a grammar structure, intentionally or unintentionally?

Anyway, here's that conlang in question. A conlang, basically as simple as can be.

Alphabet
The alphabet is pretty small, with only 13 letters;
A: /a/
B: /b/
C: /k/
E: /e/
F: /f/
I: /i/
J: /j/
L: /l/
N: /n/
O: /o/
P: /p/
S: /s/
T: /t/

Example sentences
Keep in mind, these do not dictate how the language should be spoken! Any sentence that conveys the meaning you want, is correct. This is just how I personally might speak in this conlang.

"Ca si jo ci." ("𐙣 𐘼𖨠𐙥𐦖") ("I see you.")
"Fo! Ci pa?" ("𖤾! 𐙥꘨") ("Hello! How are you?")
"Ta sa?" ("𐝁𐘥?") ("Is it nighttime?")
"Sa lo?" ("𐘥𐚣?") ("Is it raining?")
"Ci fe." ("𐙥𐀏𐦖") ("You are tall.")
"Pa, ta sa." ("꘨, 𐝁𐘥")  ("Yes, it's nighttime.")
"Ce pa." ("ꕕ꘨𐦖") ("Food is good.")

Keyboard
This is an alphabetical keyboard for Tafepe:

𐙣ꕕ𐙥𐙟𐂊𐀏𐙉𖤾𐙬𖥧
𖨠ꎍ𖡔𐘳𐚣𐙚𐚜ꘛ𐝃𐘟
꘨꘠𞠣𐙖𐘥ꔸ𐘼𐙡𐝁𐦁𞠤

Dictionary
This is the dictionary, with only the concepts defined (since grammar is up to the speaker). There are only 31 words, but they can be combined if the speaker wants.

At the beginning of the entry is a logographical representation of the word, which can make the language easier to understand for people who don't speak it. When using the logographs, a duck [𐦖] should be used at the end if a period would be used.
